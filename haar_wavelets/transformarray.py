    Method generates a transform matrix 

    Parameters
    ----------
    N : Integer, Float
        The Generated transform matrix is quadratic NXN, N is the dimension meaning how many pixels in each column and row of the picture.
        Has to be even number and size of at least 2.

    Returns
    -------
    Transform Matrix W_N 
    
    Type:  Numpy.array

    '''
    The Transform matrix is multiplied by the matrix representing the greyscale image.
    The resulting array is going to be of the same dimension as the Transform matrix
    where each column is N/2 weighted averages followed by N/2 weighted differences.
    
    '''
    #Weighted Factor
    #The transform matrix has an interesting property, we can compute the inverse by doubling the transpose.
    # By doing variable substitution, Wn=sqrt(2)W~n we now have an orthogonal matrice where the inverse is equal to the transponat of the matrice. 
    Factor=np.sqrt(2)
    '''
    The first N/2 rows of the HWT produces a weighted average of the input list (column of matrice) taken two at a time. The weighted factor is sqrt(2)
    The last N/2 rows of the HWT produce a weighted difference of the input list (column of matrice) taken two at a time.
    The weighted factor is also sqrt(2).

Now we will make some simple tests to prove the function yields the transform matrix as expected,
We know from the assignment instruction how the transform matrix W8 I supposed to look. So we reproduce this matrix manually 
and do a boolean comparison, we will also do some minor tests, we cant make a transform matrix of size N < 2 and uneven numbers.
